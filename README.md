# MENTAL HEALTH APPLICATION

## Overview
Mental Health Application is a platform designed to provide accessible mental health support by connecting individuals experiencing depression with compassionate volunteers. This community-driven solution leverages technology to facilitate meaningful connections, ensuring timely and personalized support. Volunteers are recognized for their contributions through a token-based reward system recorded securely on a blockchain.

## Problem Statement
In today's fast-paced world, many individuals experience depression and mental health challenges, often feeling isolated and unsupported. Access to professional mental health services can be limited due to barriers such as cost, stigma, and availability. Our platform aims to bridge this gap by connecting individuals with supportive volunteers, providing an accessible and community-driven solution to mental health support.

## Uniqueness and Innovativeness
1. **Community Empowerment**: Fosters a sense of community by connecting users with volunteers and recognizing their contributions through a token-based reward system.
2. **Blockchain Transparency**: Utilizes blockchain technology to record transactions, ensuring transparency and trust in the reward system.
